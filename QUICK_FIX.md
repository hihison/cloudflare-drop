# Quick Fix Summary

Your Cloudflare Drop deployment is failing because it's missing required database and storage configurations. Here's what you need to do:

## 🚨 Immediate Fix Required

### 1. Create Cloudflare Resources
Run these commands in your terminal:

```powershell
# Create D1 Database
npx wrangler d1 create airdrop

# Create KV Namespace  
npx wrangler kv:namespace create "file_drops"
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

Add these **Repository secrets**:
- `D1_ID`: (Database ID from step 1)
- `D1_NAME`: `airdrop`
- `KV_ID`: (Namespace ID from step 1)
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID

### 3. Re-run Deployment
Go to **Actions** tab → Find the failed deployment → **Re-run all jobs**

## 🛠️ Automated Setup (Recommended)

I've created a PowerShell script to automate the resource creation:

```powershell
.\setup-windows.ps1
```

This script will:
- Create the D1 database
- Create the KV namespace
- Display the IDs you need for GitHub secrets

**Note**: The error occurs because your application expects a D1 database bound as "DB" and a KV namespace bound as "file_drops", but these weren't configured in your Cloudflare account or GitHub secrets.
